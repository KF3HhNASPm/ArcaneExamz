# ArcaneExamz
Script for generating randomized exams with questions and answers randomization using LaTeX and Python. 
Development in progress and tutorials will be added in the foreseeable future.
So far: works on windows, make sure you have latex installed - it's used for compilation... check in pycharm, it should work...
